Integrate a mobile website with animations in CSS

###Scenario
I have just been recruited at Ohmyfood as a junior developer. 
Ohmyfood is a new startup that wants to make a name for itself in the restaurant business and intends to create a 100% mobile-friendly site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants. In addition to having a classic reservation system, customers will be able to select the dishes they want for their meal so that they are ready when they arrive. No more wait times in restaurants!

###Junior Developer’s Objective
The objective is to create a home page and four menu pages by integrating CSS animations. Use of SASS would be a plus.
The complete project brief can be found here - You can find the models of the site here

###Technologies:

• Development must be done in CSS, without JavaScript.

• No framework should be used, however the use of SASS is a plus.

• No CSS code should be applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag.

###Compatibility:

• The site is developed using the mobile-first approach. On tablet and desktop, the site must adapt, the layout is free.

• Pages must pass W3C validation in HTML and CSS without error.

• The site must be fully compatible with the latest desktop versions of Chrome and Firefox

###Content

• 1 home page

• 4 menu pages.

• The header is present on all pages with a return to home button on the 4 menu pages.

• The footer is identical on all pages with a reference to an email address on contact.

###Animations

• Buttons: On hover, the background color of the main buttons should lighten slightly. The shadow cast will also need to be more visible. The heart-shaped button should gradually fill in. For this first version, the effect may appear when hovering on desktop instead of clicking.

• On the home page, a "loading-spinner" appears upstream, from 1 to 3 seconds, the design of which is free.

• Upon arrival on the menu page, the dishes should appear gradually with a slight lag in time.

• The visitor can add the dishes he wants to his order by clicking on it. This brings up a small check mark to the right of the dish. This checkmark should slide from right to left. For this first version, the effect can appear when hovering on desktop instead of clicking. If the title of the dish is too long, it will need to be cropped with ellipses.
